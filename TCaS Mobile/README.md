#TCaS Mobile iOS
An iOS version of [TCaS Mobile](https://github.com/kylemsguy/tcas-mobile)

This allows access to Two Cans and String from an iOS device

Currently this app is very early in development. The backend is currently nowhere near the Java version's.

##Download
Currently there are no downloads as this app is far from complete. If you wish to try it out, feel free to compile it yourself with Xcode.

##Repository Information
The _master_ branch will contain the most stabile version of the app.

The _devel_ branch will contain the most up-to-date development version of the app.

All development will initially start on the _master_ branch, and then it will move to the devel branch once a basic version is finished, at which point a _devel_ branch will be created.
